        <p>I'll have to agree, many religions have a fascinating history and a lot of symbolism around it. I try to take inspiration in them, bringing out the cool parts, but it is always a touchy subject to write on. There will be a character loosely inspired from Buddhism making an appearance later on, I just hope I don't offend too many people when I'm pulling at these strings for inspiration. <span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">(｀• ω •´)</span></span></p>            </div>

        <p>As for the chain, Sofia understand that's it's meant as an intimidation tool, and she notes that it isn't even tightened correctly, then when everyone leaves the room she just slides her foot off. Though maybe it is also not written in the clearest of ways. (;ﾞ°´ω°´)</p>

        <p>The mana part is a bit counter-intuitive but this is fully intended and has to do with how the system works. (;ﾞ°´ω°´)</p>
        <p>As for the Skeleton, it might be confusing, I'm sorry. It's actually like this because the skill and the summon have the same name, but level up separately.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Holy Skeleton] - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Level 1 (Lv. 1) -&gt; </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Level 5 (Lv. 2)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here the skill <span style="font-weight: 400">[Holy Skeleton]</span> went from level 1 to 5, while the 'Summoned hero' Holy Skeleton went from level 1 to 2. This is made clearer later when the skeleton is given a name but until then... please bear with it. (╥﹏╥)</p>

        <p>This is exactly how it works, only killing. Using skills levels up the skill itself, but to level up your class there is no shortcut, only killing things. Crafters are indeed a rare commodity, although they do not need to level up their class to have their main skill at a high level.</p>
        <p>Most livestock is indeed level 1 or 2, giving very little xp, though the xp requirements for the first few levels are really low, so it adds up over time and a villager might reach about level 15 at some point just by virtue of killing chickens for food over their whole life. It's not that killing something of a lower level gives no experience, but it very rapidly gives increasingly less as the level gap widens. Keep in mind anything the narrator says when in Sofia's pov is still only really what Sofia experiences but doesn't actively think in phrases, she's sometimes straight up wrong or make false assumptions.</p>
        <p>Either way, the reality of this system is that most humans won't even reach level 10 in their lifetime, by design. As for how anyone could possibly still get experience at higher levels without having to hunt that one wolf that decimated half the kingdom's sheeps for xp, or resorting to mass murder, it's a very simple case of not every species/race/individual being born at level 1.</p>
        <p>I can't say much more about the why or how the system ended up like this without spoiling major plot points, so this will have to do for now <span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">(｀• ω •´)ｂ</span></span></p>            </div>

        <p>Robbery isn't exactly all that common in large cities. Most people who can afford to be there are still nobles or somewhat well off, meaning, probably not quite level one or two, what's with slime farms, carrying and all that. When anyone can potentially throw lightning or fire balls, can you really take that much risk often enough for it to be worth it? Also this was in the early morning.</p>            </div>

        <p>Now about the alternate pov chapters... I'm thinking about it!

        <p>I want to reciprocate but I also want to wait until I have a bigger following so it can be more impactful (⌐■_■)</p>
        <p>I've gone and purchased the ads, half out of excitement and half out of fear honestly, I don't really know how long I can stay in rising stars and I want to really make the most of it. Reaching the front page would help a lot for later I assume. And it's also incredibly addicting to see the numbers go up, I have gacha gamer brain. I guess if the patreon ends up doing well enough I'll be able to purchase even more ads anyway. Now I just need to proofread and edit enough chapters to set it up, and pray it all works out...</p>

        <p>I'll see what I can do for the patreon, I'm thinking a single tier with fifteen chapters for now, upping the number when we reach certain milestones, I do have the backlog to back it up, but I need to do the proofreading and editing first, so It's hard to have that much ready on a short notice (；・∀・) fifteen is already pushing it, even.</p>

        <p>Hey, I see your point, there's always a lot of things to be said about litrpg progression, and of course it's hard to get it just right.</p>
        <p>But honestly I think that out of all the problems you raised, the only one that is actually impacting this story is how hard it is to keep track of every skill etc, which is something I try to improve later, but in the end, gotta have those skills. Everything else you shouldn't worry about. When you need the numbers I'll feed them to you, the rest of the time just enjoy the ride. As for power creep and all that, I've thought out this system well enough, I think, that this won't become a problem in the long run. Anyway, thanks for your feedback :)</p>            </div>

        <p>Of course it's unlikely, that why it's called luck, right? But also, there is a reason why it's so 'easy' to get some good things out of there. S rank blessings are not all that special. Pretty much a third of heroes will be offered at least one. There's a reason why the heroes are in such high demand you know.</p>
        <p>The SSS rank one though? Now <span style="text-decoration: underline">this</span> is really lucky. But that happens.</p>            </div>

        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>I totally see where you're coming from. I still catch myself sometimes writing four lines long sentences, and needing to break them down afterwards. So you can imagine how the more subtle stuff may go over my head. I blame English not being my first language, although that's just a weak excuse. I'm trying hard to improve and make everything flow better. But I'll need some more time to adjust.</p>

            <p>that meant the average level of monsters in here was over one hundred."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is as far as Sofia knows... And she's wrong (´∀｀)</p>
        <p>Dungeons are just places of interest of the world marked by the system, it's not some magical thing, you can never tell if what you'll find inside is an interesting artifact of old or your death. The recommended level is just a gauge to know how likely you are to die, not to clear the thing. Though the son of Dread could have been killed by a level 50 yes, under the right circumstances.</p>
        <p>And this is the human continent where most people are around level 5, of course most of these things would go unnoticed or unexplored.There aren't even that many humans compared to the space they occupy, you need not even leave the kingdom to find uncharted territories. But there are wars for land nonetheless, driven by the easier to access natural resources... and personal grudges.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all make sense as far as I'm concerned, though I do see what you mean, It's just that I haven't explained the setting that much, but truth be told, Sofia could have fled in any direction and still found a new dungeon at some point. Unless you follow the human roads you will inevitably end up finding one.</p>

        <p>So, first of all thanks for the edit, really fly over my head as a non native english speaker this thing. Can't say more about realms, need that for future plot. Also Sofia is always going to be herself, does she seem extra evil? You might be surprised to see where this skill ends up later :3</p>
        <p>Heroes are a thing because they're strong of course, Pareth is already a powerhouse for his level, especially for a skeleton :D</p>
        <p>Triple merging... well it's coming, at some point ;)</p>
        <p>And finally, the patreon (which is already on the more expansive side imo) is obviously set to charge on the day of subscribing, I made extra sure of that, especially since I'm launching it this so close to the end of the month, I'm not here to scam anyone, impostor syndrome hits hard enough as it is...</p>

        <p>Not sure how you understood it, what happens is that both the [skill] and the (summon) leveled up from 71 to 84, as it's all linked to Sofia's level. Anyway, this way of showing level ups in the stat tables is something I drop later on because it gets too confusing, even for me (っ´▽｀)っ</p>            </div>

        <p>That is true and something I have been and am still considering. But at the same time it helps give a conclusion to this whole thing and a reason as to why she isn't getting chased more vehemently. Since the next actual confrontation with the church isn't coming soon for the reasons explained in this chapter, it would have felt bad to let this false feeling of urgency run rampant for the reader for so long when it was all just a big nothing burger.</p>
        <p>My experience with this is games where the main story quest constantly urges you to go fast and keep pushing to create urgency when you can actually stop and play side missions forever and nothing happens (looking at you, cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher3). Since it's something I strongly dislike, I opted to go this way. Though, being honest, it's a tough balancing act. Hopefully the adventuring and unveiling of the world will be enough to shift the interest in her progression to an healthier interest in how she is going to go about getting stronger.

        <p>The cost is always 10k mana, so she has to charge it all the way or it fail and dissipates like any other skill that you cut mid-channeling. She can charge it more though, which helps refine it more / give it more precision and speed, but no increase in actual firepower.</p>            </div>

        <p>My headcanon (I know I'm the author but hey) is that since Sofia is using modern expressions all the time (because heroes brought them to this world), Alith is picking them up from her in the off-screen time together. But sometimes even that sounds like a stretch ahah</p>
        <p>I'll see, I think I'll go through all the chapters that are out now and try to at least cut down on things that really seem too modern, but she will actually learn and start using them along the way. </p>
        <p>And well, people who come up with good edits are always very much appreciated, there's the odd people outs pointing out wrong/too nitpicky things every so often but that's far eclipsed by all the good that's come out of it. Glad to have you around (,,・ω・,,)</p>            </div>

        <p>You're out there assuming a lot about how she was doing, which was not how you described it for the most part. But even besides that, there are two more things to take in consideration</p>
        <p>1- the system is choosing 'heroes', not random peasants, but people with potential. Most of them are anything but what you'd expect.</p>
        <p>2- there is a slight bit of memory editing shenanigans going on, as you could guess from the fact that everyone speaks the same language for example</p>

        <p>Interesting topic. There's some translation shenanigans going on with how her speech pattern isn't epoch apropriate for sure. But the issues you point out aren't from this. In my eyes they aren't even issues.</p>
        <p>Alith is written as someone who exceptionnaly quick to take decision, learn, and to adapt to new things. And she's aleeady been around Sofia for quite a while. Talking to her all the time, asking questions 'offscreen', and otherwise being exposed to both the system and the undead, since Pareth is an integral part of the group.</p>
        <p>So this is how her saying these things happen.</p>            </div>

        <p>So it's kinda hard to spot but you can tell because she was told in the beginning to train [Summon  hero] even without the mana to cast it that system a skill you don't fully cast disapears. So it's all or nothing.</p>

        <p>I don't really get why you'd be fine with the system instantly teaching the same otherwordly new language to every summoned person and then draw the line at 'they don't talk how people used to back then'. If alith ever references something that didn't exist in her time do let me know though, different issue. And about the relationship feeling forced... idk sometimes it's like that, I see how  you could find it weird but at the same time, what isn't, in relationships. I just don't have time to expand on it too much</p>            </div>

        <p>Well, Kuli's personality is very 'hit first, ask questions later', which is also why most people are scared of her, like the receptionist. Though she means well, her methods are... questionable. Besides, you cannot reach such a high level if you're not somewhat 'special'. In whatever meaning of the word.</p>
        <p>As for the summoning, I feel like I can talk a bit more about it now. It depends on a few things. For Alith, the magic and system tried really hard to fit the description, however it could, summoning a dead young woman. In most cases though... nothing in [Summon Hero] dictates what kind of 'Hero' that may be...</p>
        <p>They are not carefully selected is what I'm working toward to saying. As this chapter somewhat showcases.</p>
        <p>There is a reason for this, but I will not spoil.</p>

        <p>No worries,</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The setting is what it is, you need a <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span> strong drive to reach a high level, and so it's not just anyone that can get there, which doesn't mean you have to be a completely messed up nutcase, though some are. And despite that, the world can be how it is, there are other powers at play in that, the system for example is one of them. And positions like the guildmaster's have much more to them than merely managing a place for adventurers or things like that. Be it political and public influence, knowledge, connections, strength... And for most of them, these will be roles they built themselves. </span></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, with how little we have seen of these strong people yet, I wouldn't blame anyone for misunderstanding how they are. Just know that wherever they are, whatever they do, these are powerhouses of the human world, and it's unlikely you could ever guess their whole reasoning when they do something.</span></span></p>

        <p>You have a point, but the first part has to be the slavery one imo. Maybe I'll think about adding elements to make it clearer that it's on Earth to it instead.

        <p>I have been summoned again (｀∀´)Ψ</p>
        <p>Let's see what opinions I have to argue about this time...</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>she hasn't shown a hint of regret</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yeah why would she? She did what she wanted to do. People dramatize the soul slap like it was some kind of ungodly torture but this is coming from a person who has killed more than she can count, she's far past being devastated at inflicting some harm. She's sorry that it hurt more than intended but that's it.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also don't understand what difference it will make to show what it feels like to any other saint it's not like they have an opinion on when to summon heroes</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But they do? Not every country and religion treat their saints like the Church does. And Sofia at the moment is also free to chose whether to summon or not, technically... The guildmaster isn't going around doing that to the Saints that are imprisoned, it's because they're free that she feels she needs to 'teach' them...</p>

        <p>Is it a morally twisted way to get a message across? By today's standard, for sure.</p>
        <p>Is it punishing someone that was enslaved and forced to summon heroes? Not really. By the guildmaster's information :</p>
        <p>1- Sofia didn't summon anyone during her stay at the church 2- She summoned two Heroes in the meantime 3- Sofia is not currently enslaved.</p>
        <p>So she's a 'free' saint, currently summoning heroes left and right, two in a month. Whether she needed to do so to survive isn't even an argument, she summoned them. Since she is willingly summoning Heroes, she must know what it really is. Hence the 'lesson'.</p>
        <p>And finally, she probably knows best if it works or not, she's been around for a really long time if she has seen many saints come by.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm not saying you should like her for it or anything like that, she did what she did. But it's all a question of perspective, she's centuries old, far past being stupid.</p>
        <p>I just find it weird how hard it is for some people to understand that there's more to this than 'she punished someone who was already a victim wtf', who knew a soul slap could cause that much debate, you're in for a ride, people, this isn't even one of the bad actors of this world ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>            </div>

        <p>She's only wrong because the system broke, I don't think that should be a part of anyone's assessment of her actions, to the people of this world the system not working properly is not something that can happen. I'm not even taken aback at people rejecting her thinking, just that would be whatever, I'm surprised at the sheer size and violence of that hatred.</p>
        <p>I'm human too, mate, seeing people write page long essays about why I'm a stupid bum for writing a character like that is never something I, or any other author should have to expect or accept.

        <p>And final point: this ain't the real world. I made it up. Crazy, I know.</p>            </div>

        <p>I'm a bit tired so I won't go in depth about stuff again, but I do see what you mean on all points, and like let's be honest, if the reactions were this disproportionate then I probably also did a shoddy job as portraying things in a decent way.</p>
        <p>Although, with my vision of this world and these characters, despite all the things I've read here, if I had to rewrite this scene I'd do it the same.</p>
        <p>There will be more of the guildmaster later so everyone can be mad again（　´∀｀）hahah…</p>
        <p>And finally, let me say that if I'm still here talking instead of deleting and blocking, it does mean that I think everyone here is still acting perfectly fine. I've been a bit snarky with my real world punchline but that's just my tired sense of humor.

        <p>You don't say! It is what it is, guess history has shown that this wasn't enough of a reminder for the Saints to think twice about summoning heroes, or the guildmaster wouldn't ever go through the effort of doing this in the first place (´･ᴗ･ ` )</p>            </div>

        <p>Hmm, yeah I see what you mean. These details are things I think about. Just that I cut the thinking part from the script, exactly for the sake of flow, not of logic but of pacing.</p>
        <p>For example, on the weapon choice. Alith's going for 'war sickles', or kamas, essentially, because she used to defend herself from forest animals with her sickle as an herbalist. Meanwhile Sofia is going for a flanged mace and buckler on the guildmaster's recommendation, as these are quite convenient to carry and to use, especially for someone who doesn't have much experience with wielding weapons. And she skimps on the quality of her own set because she only bought it as a backup/last resort in the first place, since she will always try to be the back-line in fights.</p>
        <p>All thing I've taken into account while the characters chose their equipment but I've not included exactly to try making the chapter nicer to read.</p>
        <p>Well, it's all a big balancing act in the end, I'm still trying to figure out what works best (￣▽￣)</p>            </div>

        <p>Well well, interesting topics going on here. Can't say much sadly, because heavy spoilers. But do keep in mind that 'Saint' is a specific-per-god, unique, god-given class. The only skill they all have in common is [Summon hero] at level 1. But we can get a peek at what the saints from skyreach's god get, and if keywords like [Angel's ] say anything...</p>
        <p>And it's not benign that the saint tower is separate from the hero tower, separate from the regular tower. Whatever that may implicate <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>

        <p>They are not immortal, but they are a long lived race, and coupled with the fact that most are born at very high levels, most of them do live quite long.</p>
        <p>But to have your kids be born at such high levels and still have a body that pretty much looks 'human', means that it's extremely hard on both the mother and the baby's bodies. And for reasons I can't explain right now, healing magic doesn't help in that case. They have ways around it but they are costly. So for vampires to have kids is either an act of foolishness or a huge financial drain. Each newborn vampire is a precious resource to them, and they highly value every vampire's life.</p>
        <p>Note however that this whole thing, while not unique to vampires, is truer for them than most. Each species have their own way to deal with things like that, Elves for example are born near level one but... And I'll stop there for spoilers. (⌐■_■)</p>            </div>

        <p>Forget all you know about every race, besides the humans I'm changing pretty much everything, ah well, dwarves are still stubby rock enjoyers and elves are still pointy eared woodmongers, but they have a lot more going on besides that, much like vampires drink blood but... you get my point  <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Fair point. Honestly I almost want to write extra chapters just to go off on that kind of lore, but well, not time for that right now. Not sure many people would be interested even. Maybe when people are more invested in the story a few hundred chapters later. hmmm</p>            </div>

        <p>And not expanding is dangerous in a review + rating sense, I know you can't see it but you have no idea how much I hate I got from people who understood nothing of chapters 30-31.

        <p>Alright, so:</p>
        <p>You indeed get active and passive class skills when you get them, no choice. But you can chose which one to to forget when you take a new one if your slots are full, or to not take the new one, think like pokemon skills.</p>
        <p>The princess only had 5 passives, but [Blessing of the Deep] kinda invited itself there.</p>
        <p>Of course, she had five passives at level one and no actives, this is just a specificity of the [Princess] class. Every class has some quirks about what skills it learns when.</p>
        <p>She only had 5 classless though, which is one less than Sofia who has 6 because she has that compensation slot for her broken class. And classless can be obtained simply by doing/ knowing things. Which is why you can learn some of them by being taught or through a skill scroll. And maybe through some other ways, even ;)</p>

        <p>Some of the feedback is sound and I do consider it to try to improve, but there's also a lot of critique about characters not acting the way people would like and that's honestly not something I think I should change in any way. Also some of the reviewers were clearly just trolls, that I would know considering the insults they sent me in DMs, so it really hurts to see their reviews get so much traction...</p>            </div>

        <p>This is something I understand better than ever now yes... When I started gaining a bit of popularity I expected it to happen at some point even, to some degree. But I guess the scale of it all still surprised me. I never thought so many people would go out of their way to express their dislike of what I made... Especially since it's free. This is all very new to me, honestly has me almost waiting to drop out of Rising Stars, just so this negativity can lessen a bit.</p>            </div>

        <p>I don't even know how I want to process criticism and feedback for now... I'm literally a beginner, though I guess this story's numbers don't reflect that. I know my story has weak points but it's demoralizing when that's all that I hear about. I have a really bad tendency to focus too much on the negative...</p>
        <p>I guess no matter what, it all boils down to the fact that I need to develop a thicker skin... I'm just not used to it yet.</p>

        <p>Edit: ah, turns out I remembered wrong, the fact that there was a part about rituals is in the next chapter actually, my memory bad <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Laughing002-min-AABAgxA9Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Oh I love reading stuff like this (⌐▨_▨)</p>
        <p>Alright, so, I can't give a definite canon health number, but I can slightly correct a few things here, though I must say, you did a great job with the info available (▼∀▼)</p>
        <p>So, the actual hp multiplier for most fighter classes is x2.5, so they have 50 at level one, and get 50 more per level (Only Sofia's mana stat doesn't work like that because it's so bugged, where she had 5000 at level one and gets 500 per level)</p>
        <p>So the base health at level 100 would be 5000. Now, Pareth is a very special case, because he has two modifiers. In Holy Skeleton's description it says : "<span style="font-weight: 400">Physical and magical capabilities are influenced by the current bones. "</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which is rather vague, but the actual meaning is the stats are altered to better represent that of the type of original creature whose skeleton it's occupying (with a range from -50% to +50% depending on the skeleton) in this case the Elven skeleton is pretty close to an human so it would only be a few additional percents. (This part of the skill also represents that he can't properly use the sword without hands etc but that's details)</span></p>
        <p>Next is the blessing, which is actually a linear scaling of 100 flat Health and Strength points per kg and not a % buff. But you got the weight correct, so in total, Pareth's health at the time was actually a tiny bit over 9000 ;)</p>
        <p>Which is a big amount, but also he had no armor whatsoever so the Siren still absolutely destroyed him. Though he did tank a few hits. You can see how he got annihilated at the end,supposedly by some sort of water spell, when Sofia only took about 300 dmg from the water ball spell. So yeah, armor is a very big deal too.</p>
        <p>Now this makes me realize I screwed up with the scaling of [Heal undead] (which I already changed a few times...) so I'll have to go back to look into it...</p>
        <p>Anyway, nice job <span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">(｀• ω •´)b</span></span></p>

        <p>So. Actually this is a thing that I might have changed along the way so it's possible there's contradicting information in the early chapters somewhere. How it works now is forgotten skills are completely lost, except for classless skills, which you can get back at the level you forgot them (although switching too often might bring about penalties).</p>            </div>

        <blockquote>

According to Ovohen, the weaker ones would reappear in a few months, owing to the cursed nature of this underground abyss. A terrible monster resided at the very bottom, held by seals placed by the first oracle himself.</span></p>

        <p>I can't vouch for it since I haven't read either version, but I've seen from the reviews that apparently this rewrite basically reversed these problems the first version had. For what it's worth, so I wouldn't be so quick to disparage it.</p>
        <p>Let's not forget that most of us authors on RR are really just starting out on our creative journey, the room for improvement is huge.

        <p><span style="font-size: 0.9em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It's alright this battle is a bit longer than usual but it's not Dragon Ball Z kind of long. And about the scale... well he just collapsed a third a mountain. Not a hill, a mountain. I feel like that's a lot already. Though, he is indeed quite limited in variety due to his rather unusual class. </span></span></p>

        <p>What it does exactly is not actually messing with time at all (yes the skill description is technically wrong), rather altering Sofia's position and physical state to be 'as if' she took another choice a few seconds ago. In Orvod's eyes she's essentially just teleporting around.</p>            </div>

        <p>Yep that's how it would work, you could trade heavy blows, go back, be healed and the enemy still hurt. And indeed the description is strange, you could say mr. scribe is a bit out of his comfort zone here. These are skills he's never even heard about, and since they aren't system provided, it's way harder for it to get a good grasp on how they work <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>That's all a very complex topic, especially since all saints get different skills and stat growth depending on their patron god. But in her case, she's got weak physical stats all around, and a shit ton of mana, which is also what necromancer gives, so they compounded to make her how she is. Her two bases classes are meant to be supporting classes essentially. She'll always have a weaker body. But both classes have some more or less hidden very strong perks to improve survivability, she's just yet to discover them. As you could guess, going Lich is one of them.</p>
        <p>Not that she needs to rely on any of that anyway, since her class skills can potentially be anything she may lack.</p>            </div>

        <p>That's partly right, but also, while she did her best to copy the mana flow, it's far for perfect, since she isn't used to such fine control without the system's help, so really it was a weakened version of the level 100 skill in the first place. Exactly like how her home-brew identify gave much less information than the system operated skill usual gives.</p>            </div>

        <p>It would be level one because she doesn't have the [Holy skeleton] skill, meaning she could only use the regular skeleton summoning ritual, the same she used in chapter one. It's quite special because she's usually not really using the skill, just ordering Pareth around. Angel's bolt was her doing her best to copy her actual mana movement of the skill so it wasn't as good as her actual lvl100 version, but it wasn't as weak as when it was level1 either.</p>            </div>

        <p>In any other context I would agree, but at that exact point, Sofia has already accepted in her mind that these people were all fake re-creations of the past. Though she would still feel weird about it, that wouldn't be anywhere near the same impact as killing a real person.</p>
        <p>Especially so since as far as she could tell, these guys pretty much deserved it, even if it didn't exactly involve her.</p>            </div>

        <p>Some people are just never happy I guess? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
        <p>I don't even know what to say, no matter what I do people will complain. Besides I find it very weird to say that Sofia doesn't have any agency or that it can't be normal that she has to kill a lvl299 hero when she's the one who's been derailing the trial all this while.</p>
        <p>And what's going on is the real goal of the trial just started. It was literally in the title of the trial she chose herself : </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>‘Thief’s Commitment’</em></strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: center"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no escape</span></em></p>
            <p style="text-align: center"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Opportunity awaits the bold.</span></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: left">That's it, she must commit to her theft, she who has been using an 'angel's bolt' all this time, now here's the angel and his bolts. Do I really have to spell it all out the second the thing starts?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">Man it must be hell out there for authors who only post two or three chapters a week if everybody is so unwilling to wait for the story to happen.</p>            </div>

        <p>I mean, I know a lot of stuff won't be obvious, I don't hold it against anyone if you don't instantly connect all the dots, if I wanted it to be clearer it would have been, but it's because Sofia herself is lost that everything is blurry, since she's the narrator most of the time. It's a hard thing to balance honestly.</p>
        <p>Most of the stuff that doesn't make sense upfront will do later, there's a lot of stuff going on with this trial that run deeper than just 'sofia is going to be level 100', plot points that won't be revealed until hundreds of chapters later if things go how I plan. Guess I just like my foreshadowing a bit too much. I'm doing my best alright.To be clear, most of what's happening all the time will be important later, I hope that this whole 'random' bit of the past will help make stuff that comes later make more sense, since you will know how some things came about.</p>
        <p>And for everyone who wants Sofia to be more in control, she will, eventually, but right now of course she's being thrown around, she's a teenie tiny level 99 on the chessboard of angels and gods and stuff. How could she not? I'd say she will really start to hit her stride around chapter 100-120. Weak to strong, all this jazz <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>And yeah it's a whole thing to try to make the story good in a chapter to chapter sense while keeping an overall well paced and coherent story. Like, it might feel like the trial has been going on forever but that also was only 15 chapters, that's barely longer than the first arc in the church. And to be honest, kind of a failure on my part but I thought readers would be more interested in learning about the history of the kingdom and such, but I guess not. I never even though that Sofia being in Aurelia's body would be a problem to anyone, to me it was pretty much as if she wore a disguise, though I suppose that turned off some people, as did the demon transformation.</p>
        <p>Well, please bear with it, it's almost over, trial ends in two chapters <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Love003-min-AACAODU9Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>It's alright, if anything I'm only mad at myself for not writing this whole thing better. I've just been a bit too ambitious with the setting I guess, it ended up making the whole thing be a bit of a mess. Hopefully when more things are uncovered in later arcs you can all come back to this and think 'oh so this is what was going on'. Because this is the most I can do to salvage this at this point <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Laughing002-min-AABAgxA9Xgw=.png"></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I've been waiting for the trial to end so we can get back to the story.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I get where your frustration comes from, it's just hard to manage, to me this is the story, much more than it would have been it the trial had been a 1v1 against some generic monster, see what I mean? But at least everyone would have understood everything. Anyway, I've added a little Q&amp;A in the author notes, hopefully that can help make stuff a bit less confusing overall</p>            </div>

        <p>I get all your points, some bits were clumsy like that, like the fact the ritual had never been mentioned before, but besides that everything will make sense later... It's really hard to refrain myself from spoiling I'll have to say.</p>
        <p>Sometimes stuff just looks like it doesn't make sense and I can only ask everyone to trust that I actually know what I'm doing <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Dead002-min-AADA2Bc8Xgw=.png"></p>

        <p>Well, all trials are meant to be hard, even the first one. And she also went the extra mile to kill the hero and such which wasn't required and made it all even harder. But Sofia is a bit of a special case, for some reasons you could guess and some you couldn't yet, so it's even even more fucked than usual, though it's a bit spoiler territory.</p>
        <p>Either way, it is an unusual first trial, I think the stats was about two thirds of people make it out of the first one, when clearly this is harder than that. Not a plot hole though. But you only know what Sofia knows so... <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>Anyway don't worry too much about being offensive, if I'm still answering it means it's a.ok <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/peocheckmark-AABA5wJUsww.png"></p>
        <p>Now, and because I like make things interesting there's something I'm surprised no one pointed out yet. And it's how she needed to be in the city for the trial's second part to start, but nothing was in place to keep her there.</p>
        <p>Now you can all ponder over how an archangel could make that kind of weird mistake <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Don't go getting all angry because you don't like how the story goes, when has the system ever explained how things worked clearly? That's not something it's been doing ever. The only time Sofia gets a full on explanation is when she directly breaks something and gets an error message.</p>

        <p>This comment thread is the gift that keep on giving. Alright, so.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The parts don't seem to be logically related</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yeah that's because they aren't. It's just that they both fit well with what the system wants to test Sofia on, and happen to be chronologically linked. Reminder, this is a piece of real history, not a system crafted situation. And the trial couldn't be just the second part, that would be too short, so it's two parts, related by the fact they happen one after the other. The fact that there's a second part doesn't mean it should be linked to the first or that the first had no reason to exist.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Narratively, the quest wasn't presented as a multi-part quest</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Sofia didn't know so you didn't know, simple as that. And why did the system 'hide it'? It's just not part of the information it gives. Any time you assume you know how the system works is a time where you risk being wrong. For all you know, Sofia could kill herself right now and still get her level 100 for completing the first part. Or maybe she'd just die. Is it explained? Nope. That's how the system is, and considering the system fucking up is how the whole story started, I find it surprising that anyone is still surprised when the system doesn't work like a squeaky-clean well oiled machine.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Also, we aren't talking about whether Sofia understands, what's going on. The issue is that the reader doesn't understand</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>She is the narrator 99% of the time. She doesn't get something? Either you piece it together yourself or you wait for her to understand. Simple as that. And all that's going on is that 'surprise', there's another quest after the first. Now was it presented clumsily? Perhaps, or there probably wouldn't be that much discussion about it. But it really isn't that big of a deal even if you don't understand how or why that came about in my opinion. It's there now, and Sofia has to deal with it, that's all it is. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>            </div>

        <p>Also it's me being snarky but if you really want to nitpick the trial prompt: <strong>[Trial completion : Survive the solstice (728 hours remain)]</strong></p>
        <p>Technically it's still the solstice, so she hasn't survived it. And the timer never precised whether that was the end of when she needed to survive or the start of it. Though, now, since this message changed to this <strong>[Trial completion : Commit to your thievery before the true solstice’s end]</strong>, she theoretically isn't even required to survive anymore.

        <p>I need to get back to writing so I won't expand too much again. Overall I agree with most of your points, I just don't think that case in particular was such a big deal. A tad blurry maybe, mistake on my part, but we also have a bit of a mountain out of a molehill on this subject imho. When you boil it all down, it's just a second part to the trial, just that it wasn't announced before. And the reason why it's like this in world simply is something I can't let readers know about for now.</p>            </div>

        <p>Honestly didn't mean it like that, I've just been trying to pinpoint what went wrong, and offer clarification. As well as being equally confused about what it was exactly that people didn't get. No blaming just confusion.</p>

        <p>My bad, I should probably just not write a book because you just know that whatever happens, the main character won't die in the middle. Next time I'll only write the first and last page of a story, surely you'll like that better.</p>
        <p>The real world impact is the MC's growth, which is also pretty much what the whole litrpg genre revolves around as far as I know.</p>
        <p>Truly a take I do not understand, and also frankly expressed in a rude way.</p>

        <p>See now, I get what you mean. Thank you for the clear feedback.</p>
        <p>However! I don't think that's too much of a big deal. In my opinion not everything has to have huge tension for the reader. Of course from the reader's perspective the trial is as good as won already but that's not how it is to Sofia. And If you're not interested in seeing how she overcomes the trial then this would mean the real problem isn't the narrative tension at all, but rather me not being able to make it interesting.</p>
        <p>Also it's really just fifteen chapters, which isn't that long for it to become a major problem, it's just that the format of webserials make it weird. For comparison the readers on patreon that could read it all at once had no complaints whatsoever. Though of course they might not be an incredible metric to judge the quality of the story, it's still something. Overall, though I think you have a point, I also think it's not a huge deal.</p>
        <p>Story chugs along, hopefully the next arc can have the readers who miss the tension more invested <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <blockquote>
            <p>I'm guessing the system just put her in a past scenario where the Angel Bolt was used previously</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's part that, part system regulations, and part something else.</p>
        <p>I'm just gonna be putting it out there that it's not exactly how a normal trial would go, because of that part something else. But anyway, since it has to be a scene of the past no matter what, you can never introduce a scene with angel's bolt being used that won't be coming out of nowhere. Angels aren't exactly the most predictable bunch.</p>            </div>

        <p>That's really what you got out of this?</p>
        <p>There was a lot of world building stuffed in there. Like a lot a lot. Enough that someone who skipped it will end up confused in later parts of the story. Things that Sofia now know and or have experienced that will also shape how she behaves later. </p>
        <p>Besides not everything someone does has to be impactful on the world at large to matter or be interesting.</p>

        <p>I swear to gods comments like this make me the most salty.<br>Here you go, a list of all the damn things she did, that were her choices, that <strong>drastically</strong> changed how the trial went.<br>-Act resigned to her fate / fan the duke's anger when he came to visit her (which made him give her the pendant + rescue her early)<br>-Find then decide to keep the obvious magic item (seal) on her<br>-Learn to use Identify without the system, later identifying the revival pendant<br>-Getting friendly with Nyse (which helped gain trust/approval from Fox)<br>-Taking control of the situation after reuniting with the duke<br>-Decide once again to keep the seal even after identifying it<br>-Knowing Nyse could draw a map of the kingdom and asking him to do it<br>-Convince the mercenary troupe into escorting + following her to an unknown dungeon despite the situation<br>-Proceed to kill herself twice to complete dubious necromantic ritual (which, no matter how you frame it, isn't an obvious choice ever)<br>-Decide to fight off Orvod instead of fleeing or searching for the duke &amp; co<br>-Use her knowledge of the kingdom (and guess what, Nyse's map) to lure him to the mana lake<br>-Guessing right about where her targets were for the bonus task.</p>
        <p>And that's without mentioning all the things she could have done, that she <span style="text-decoration: underline">decided</span> not to do.</p>
        <p>Are you getting why I'm pulling my hair when people say she had no agency and made no choices yet? The trial only went how it did because she chose to do stuff how she did. Imagine if she'd left the seal in the room, the damn heroes wouldn't even have gone to chase her.</p>

        <p>I mean, I'm fine with this or I wouldn't even be answering so don't worry about it too much. You had some interesting things to say in your other comments too, I just don't agree with this one take <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Laughing002-min-AABAgxA9Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>Long story short, I still disagree with your rebuttal there, I can see a million different ways the whole thing could have played out so I can't ever agree that she made no choices. Of course you don't have the same understanding of everything that's happened and the causality of everything so it might not be so obvious from your side though. Guess that's what I ought to work on a bit more.</p>
        <p>And just to answer the question about Orvod, yeah there were ways, if he'd made different choices about how he fought. But obviously it would have been a close fight either way if no one made any mistake. Besides she only got him because he was the one to make one.</p>            </div>

        <p>His class was magisterium, not paladin. Kinda look the same but actually very different.</p>
        <p>Basically in terms of physical stats, you can expect people under level 200 to still be in the realm of what an actual human from earth could maybe achieve in a particular domain with godly genetics and at their peak with professional training.</p>
        <p>Now, can you survive terminal velocity with somewhere between 2000-6000 health? Perhaps. While landing on hard stone floor? Much less likely. While wearing full on heavy fantasy plate armor when you're already a very tall and heavy person? That's going to be reaaally hard.</p>            </div>

        <p>the skill auto completes when you have at least a front and a back part, so consecrated mass soul grip wasn't an option</p>
        <p>[Consecrated mass dispel grip] was one though, but it sounds quite weird.

        <p>No, the blessing isn't counted as an ability, and neither is the bonus/malus% health depending on how heavy the skeleton is compared to a regular humanoid one. Everything else doubled though. Including the additional bone density, which makes the blessing that much stronger <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>Rest assured though, with a proper skeleton, Pareth is now an absolute brick shithouse. Especially since [<span style="font-weight: 400">Sanctified</span> grounds] (upgraded version of [Consecrated grounds] that he used to have) reads like this : </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grants all allies in a 100m (skill level) radius and himself a 40% increase in all physical stats. Bonus quadrupled for Skeletons.</span></p>
        <p>And it's also being buffed by the halo which empowers holy related skills... that also just had its efficiency doubled...</p>            </div>

        <p>The doubling was a one-off thing for his previous abilities.  So although it sits there in the description, it's not an ongoing effect, meaning his new effects are what they are. Hence another doubling would take it to 8 times <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>[Sanctified grounds] is an external bonus, so it will apply after everything else, including the blessing and all that goodness. Yep, that's strong.

        <p>Calculation wise this all looks fine I think, but one thing you cannot get a good estimate of is what kind of defense he has and how that compares to what Sofia had as a demon (which was very high). If the bonus from [Sanctified grounds] applied to [<span style="font-weight: 400">Shapeless armor of light] he would likely be at a comparable level but since it is another skill, we go back to the no double dipping rule.</span></p>
        <p>Which all means the spells would hit him harder especially since [<span style="font-weight: 400">Higher magical damage negation] does very little against actual stone blocks.</span> Forget the petals, he would still take damage even from the cubes, but he could survive a few.</p>
        <p>And <strong>[Heal undead] </strong>is going to get retconed actually. I need to change the values, planned the scaling poorly, that'll be in an author note soon probably.</p>            </div>

        <p>Pareth isn't the most talkative of skeletons so that won't be a hindrance, and neither is the cloth, really, won't talk much at all. But sometime it'll have something to say.</p>
        <p>And no honestly the design could have been anything but I couldn't have made the censor bar joke if it wasn't like this <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"> I also like the fact that it's specific about dumb things like hating legs and needing personal space, which led to it ending up like that. Well, maybe it's just me. Base inspiration came from Grufon, the talking map in the anime 'Wakfu', which is also a sassy annoying ass talking item.</p>            </div>

        <p>It's not quite either of these solutions, both the gravestone and the skeletons are not actually what they look like, though they still count as-if, they are unstable mana constructs. They will disappear when she stops fueling the skill. If she manages to make it a systemless spell, pulling the actual matter from the surroundings would be a change she might be able to make, creating actual stable matter is possible but another pair of gloves entirely.

        <p>In demon form, her level doesn't change, but she will have the exact same body she had during the trial, stats and all. But she will also have all her passive skills available (so the wings and armor, mostly). And no mana, so no active skills, be it the demon form ones or her own.

I feel like this could be caused either by feb being a shorter month messing things up on Patreon's end or it might have to do with how they process their payments on the first of the month making the whole platform a bit unstable that day, can't say, either way I'll be glad to count you among my patrons once you make the jump <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_EyeSparkles001-min-AAAAxl48Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Let's be honest, Sofia is unusual in the way she views the world, even for the world she's in. She's got her very own set of morals and she doesn't care much about what anyone else might think about them.</p>
        <p>That she has these conflicting thoughts about killing is much more about reality being different than her expectations. She'd always expected it to be something she would hate but still do if she had to, but it turns out she doesn't actually feel so bad about it. She still doesn't like it, but as long as she feel justified, that's it. Complex topic but yeah...</p>            </div>

        <p>Don't miss the point that usually the saints summon heroes, yes... but rarely for themselves. Of course when a saint is free there could be heroes who side with them... But they probably won't.</p>
        <p>You do understand that there's nothing tethering a Hero to their Saint, right? If anything you could assume most Heroes might have a certain... distaste for their kidnapper.</p>            </div>

        <p>Yeah the slashes are the separation, more visual than comma in my eyes, that's originally the list I have in my own docs.</p>
        <p>And for the second part, let me shed a tiny shred of light. Of course I cannot go into the details of why it was designed like that, huge spoilers, but I can speak for the frequency thing. Actually the trials do no really get more frequent. What you couldn't take into account is how much harder it is to for example go from level 400 to 401 than it is to go from 200 to 201. As the difficulty in gaining levels gets higher and higher, the trials staying at every fifty level actually spaces them out a lot more for higher levels.</p>

        <p>I mean... I see why you would think that but I <span style="text-decoration: underline">strongly</span> disagree about it being weird.</p>
        <p>If we go back to look at Sofia's past, right. She spent most of her youth in an orphanage. That's a world that has no phones, no tv, no internet. And now she's in the wide (and magical) outside world, extensively using the system that no one taught her anything about, by herself, and having to deal with bugs and a borked class. Not only that, she's now in the rather unexplored realm of being at a high-ish level, which despite how it looks is only a very tiny fraction of the population. And as if that wasn't enough, she's now in a different country literally on the other side of the human continent.</p>
        <p>Honestly if she knew more about things that's what would be weird. In my opinion.</p>
        <p>And that if feels less alien to Alith is entirely because you don't have her point of view. She's just quick (very) to adapt and not too good at externalizing her thoughts most of the time.</p>            </div>

        <p>It happens but is not widespread at all, even the priests' main job is usually healing and spreading education rather than 'spreading the word of god' or something.</p>
        <p>Pretty much everyone accepts that A. the Gods exist, and B. they pretty much only interact with Saints and Oracles. So there's no reason to pray to an entity that you know will never answer or do anything for you. Though that won't stop some people from trying.</p>
        <p>If anything, people would be more inclined to pray to the Saints or Oracles, dumb as it may sound.</p>            </div>

        <p>Mostly full skeleton (can be missing like a few minor bones but not major ones like a femur a the skull)</p>
        <p>Mostly intact and 'clean' bones, too much breakage or rotting won't work</p>

        <p>She's absolutely over-performing compared to her level, but other saints, oracles, and rare classes in general tend to do so. Though very rarely quite to this extent <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"> The greatest factor of her strength right now is the versatility her misshapen skillset allows for.</p>            </div>

        <p>-Is scribe a good situation?</p>
        <p>- You know, I don’t think there are good or bad situations. If I had to sum up my life today with you, I’d say that this is firstly meetings, people who gave me their hands may be at a moment when I couldn’t, when I was alone at home. And it is a bit curious to realize that coincidences and meetings forge a destiny because when you have the taste of the thing, when you have the taste of the well done thing, the beautiful gesture, sometimes you don’t find the speaker, I’d say, the mirror which helps you to progress. Well, it’s not my case today because I could, and I thank life, I sing life, I dance life, I’m nothing but love. And finally, when a lot of people ask me “How do you do to have this humanity?” I simply answer, it is this taste of love, this taste of water which pushed me today to undertake a mechanic construction but tomorrow, who knows, I would may be serve the community, and give the gift. The gift of myself.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Laughing002-min-AABAgxA9Xgw=.png"> ok, sorry, I know nobody will get it but I couldn't help myself, that's a quote from a french movie where a 'Scribe' describes his life situation (movie is 'Astérix &amp; Obélix: mission Cléopâtre'). I like it a lot and it fit oh sooooooo well into this discussion</p>            </div>

        <p>This does raise some questions about the origins of Midenicite as a material. <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>The book is a lot less picky about what it can skeletise compared to the raise skeleton ritual, but this ingot was a very special case, it shouldn't be expected that the book would ever eat something that isn't a corpse with its equipment in general.</p>
        <p>Everything else I won't answer here but that is indeed a lot of power. This is meant to help slay a god, after all <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Hey, thanks for reading <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>I do know about the tabletop rpg scene, if I'm being honest I write books as if I was GM, I only create settings and I let the characters live in it, if that makes sense.</p>
        <p>Now for your inquiry, uh... I'd say keep the base ideas but put your own spin on it. Not that I wouldn't love to have something like that based on my book and world, but if you ever want to promote it or make money with it, that'll save us both a headache. As for how much inspiration you should take... I dunno <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>The creative process is what it is, everyone takes inspiration from many things, me included. And unless I fucking hit my head on the stairs, I shouldn't come to sue you for using stuff like my original monster designs, which there aren't many of anyway. Well, whatever you decide to do, I can't really stop you unless you start shouting everywhere that these are you original designs and that you're selling them, so just don't do that and use your better judgement depending on what your goal is with this project. Good luck and have fun <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>You don't even know the extent of the things I've hidden in the old chapters, it'd be more shocking if you noticed more than a few. Some of them no one even commented on yet, perhaps they weren't found <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>So there's really nothing embarrassing about it, most of them after all do look like benign details at first glance <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>The paladins would have been sweeped off even faster <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>Templars are essentially alternate Paladins focused on combat only. The class is much harder to unlock. Where Paladins have a lot of healing, utilitary and protection skills, Templars are more like the heavy artillery, with the bare minimum of buffing and healing skills in their kit.</p>            </div>

        <p>Eh, there is some setup before this. Vampires are strong, Oracles too, and she is filthy rich, so of course...</p>
        <p>I mean, I still get why you would find it unsatisying. But I think it's fine like that. Just replace Astelia by a Dragon in your head, do you think It would need more build up then? I guess not because Dragons carry expectations of power already. Point is though, in a world with the system, anybody can be a dragon. <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>            </div>

        <p>Yeah it's a bit too late to check the files now, she could have maybe thought about it on the spot back then but that wasn't her most clear-headed moment.</p>
        <p>Also I can confirm that Cardinal doesn't have the fire curse, the curse is hereditary from mother to children, so you can draw the lines and guess that for Astelia to be his niece, she has to be Cardinal's brother's daughter. Also as I'm used to doing that by now, let's have a small tangant on Vampire reproduction!</p>
        <p>Aside from the fact they suffer from the low fertility and difficult childbirth inherent to being a naturally high level race, there are subtelties about how things work with the cruse. The thing is, only a female vampire can give birth to another Vampire, but Vampires can crossbreed with most other humanoid races. So female vampire + Anything = vampire; and male vampire + Anything other than vampire = not vampire. <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/peo1-min-AADAsfdKsww.png"></p>
        <hr>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About the stamina problems, in Astelia's case it's actually the counterpart or side effects from <span style="font-weight: 400">[Moon Benediction], which is what gives her so much health and mana. Her body just wouldn't be able to handle so much stats without something lacking to balance it out.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cardinal's stamina issues on the other hand, come from his magic, because he is a space mage specialized in teleportation, he is strongly affected by planar drag (aka summoning sickness) and that's what tires him. (And Astelia dones't have such problems, thanks to [Mark of The Moon])</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">PS. for the other dealings about Chino and Perenia my mouth is sealed <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smileys/reddragonowo001png-AAAAqfeL0w4.png?time=1606321541"></span></p>            </div>

        <p>I respectfuly disagree <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png"></p>
        <p>Also, rant below if you want my full opinion, because why not. <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png"></p>

                    </p><p>Speaking from experience, the negative 'critique' in reviews is hardly ever useful in any capacity beyond 'oh I guess this guy didn't like this one character' or 'oh I guess this guy doesn't like that sometimes the main character is lucky' or shit like that. Especially since the people who post them tend to not read very far at all. So I really wouldn't say that's what we're here for, as authors. For context, 90% of my bad ratings (3* and below) are from chapter 50 or earlier, with a lot frontloaded on chapters 1&amp;2. Which, as far as I'm concerned, is basically like ordering a hamburger (for free btw) and taking a dump on the restaurant counter then leaving before you even get your food, screaming 'this place smells like shit!'. That doesn't say much about the quality of the food.</p>
                    <p>I get much better insights from the comment section than from reviews and rating if I'm being honnest. <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png"></p>
                    <p>Much love to the people who leave nice reviews though, they at least achieve the purpose of making me happy <img src="https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Love003-min-AACAODU9Xgw=.png"></p>

        <p>Here's the description</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>[Graveyard of the righteous]</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> : Create a X meters (3*Skill Level) large and wide consecrated graveyard around the Saintomancer (Must be solid ground). The skeletons of the righteous dead are buried in the graveyard, their arms and upper body may surface to grab the Saintomancer’s enemies, incapacitate them and - or drag them underground. The skeletons have the relative strength and resilience of a level X (1*Skill Level) Paladin and cannot inflict any direct damage.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Requires an X seconds (10 - class level/50) channeling to deploy. Costs 100 mana per second to maintain.</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It's the 'drag underground' part that she's using to get out. Part of the skill's usage is turning things into a temporary semi-ghostly state to phase them through the ground /bury them alive. So basically by ordering the skeletons to carry her like this she can phase through the ground / walls like a ghost could.</span></p>            </div>
