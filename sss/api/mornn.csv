I try to take inspiration in them, bringing out the cool parts, but it is always a touchy subject to write on.

(;ﾞ°´ω°´)</p>
<p>As for the Skeleton, it might be confusing, I'm sorry. It's actually like this because the skill and the summon have the same name, but level up separately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0""><span style=""font-weight: 400"">[Holy Skeleton] - </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Level 1 (Lv. 1) -&gt; </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Level 5 (Lv. 2)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the skill <span style=""font-weight: 400"">[Holy Skeleton]</span> went from level 1 to 5, while the 'Summoned hero' Holy Skeleton went from level 1 to 2. This is made clearer later when the skeleton is given a name but until then... please bear with it. (╥﹏╥)</p>

Using skills levels up the skill itself, but to level up your class there is no shortcut, only killing things. Crafters are indeed a rare commodity, although they do not need to level up their class to have their main skill at a high level.</p>
<p>Most livestock is indeed level 1 or 2, giving very little xp, though the xp requirements for the first few levels are really low, so it adds up over time and a villager might reach about level 15 at some point just by virtue of killing chickens for food over their whole life. It's not that killing something of a lower level gives no experience, but it very rapidly gives increasingly less as the level gap widens. Keep in mind anything the narrator says when in Sofia's pov is still only really what Sofia experiences but doesn't actively think in phrases, she's sometimes straight up wrong or make false assumptions.</p>
<p>Either way, the reality of this system is that most humans won't even reach level 10 in their lifetime, by design. As for how anyone could possibly still get experience at higher levels without having to hunt that one wolf that decimated half the kingdom's sheeps for xp, or resorting to mass murder, it's a very simple case of not every species/race/individual being born at level 1.</p>
<p>I can't say much more about the why or how the system ended up like this without spoiling major plot points, so this will have to do for now <span style=""font-size: 0.9em""><span style=""font-weight: 400"">(｀• ω •´)ｂ</span></span></p>","3 months  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1067609?comment=7595297#comment-7595297"

<p>I want to reciprocate but I also want to wait until I have a bigger following so it can be more impactful (⌐■_■)</p>
<p>I've gone and purchased the ads, half out of excitement and half out of fear honestly, I don't really know how long I can stay in rising stars and I want to really make the most of it. Reaching the front page would help a lot for later I assume. And it's also incredibly addicting to see the numbers go up, I have gacha gamer brain. I guess if the patreon ends up doing well enough I'll be able to purchase even more ads anyway. Now I just need to proofread and edit enough chapters to set it up, and pray it all works out...</p>

<p>But honestly I think that out of all the problems you raised, the only one that is actually impacting this story is how hard it is to keep track of every skill etc, which is something I try to improve later, but in the end, gotta have those skills. Everything else you shouldn't worry about. When you need the numbers I'll feed them to you, the rest of the time just enjoy the ride.

<p>This is as far as Sofia knows... And she's wrong (´∀｀)</p>
<p>Dungeons are just places of interest of the world marked by the system, it's not some magical thing, you can never tell if what you'll find inside is an interesting artifact of old or your death. The recommended level is just a gauge to know how likely you are to die, not to clear the thing. Though the son of Dread could have been killed by a level 50 yes, under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>And this is the human continent where most people are around level 5, of course most of these things would go unnoticed or unexplored.There aren't even that many humans compared to the space they occupy, you need not even leave the kingdom to find uncharted territories. But there are wars for land nonetheless, driven by the easier to access natural resources... and personal grudges.</p>
<p>Anyway, all make sense as far as I'm concerned, though I do see what you mean, It's just that I haven't explained the setting that much, but truth be told, Sofia could have fled in any direction and still found a new dungeon at some point. Unless you follow the human roads you will inevitably end up finding one.</p>

But at the same time it helps give a conclusion to this whole thing and a reason as to why she isn't getting chased more vehemently. Since the next actual confrontation with the church isn't coming soon for the reasons explained in this chapter, it would have felt bad to let this false feeling of urgency run rampant for the reader for so long when it was all just a big nothing burger.</p>
<p>My experience with this is games where the main story quest constantly urges you to go fast and keep pushing to create urgency when you can actually stop and play side missions forever and nothing happens (looking at you, cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher3). Since it's something I strongly dislike, I opted to go this way. Though, being honest, it's a tough balancing act. Hopefully the adventuring and unveiling of the world will be enough to shift the interest in her progression to an healthier interest in how she is going to go about getting stronger.

<p>I'll see, I think I'll go through all the chapters that are out now and try to at least cut down on things that really seem too modern, but she will actually learn and start using them along the way. </p>
<p>And well, people who come up with good edits are always very much appreciated, there's the odd people outs pointing out wrong/too nitpicky things every so often but that's far eclipsed by all the good that's come out of it.

But even besides that, there are two more things to take in consideration</p>
<p>1- the system is choosing 'heroes', not random peasants, but people with potential. Most of them are anything but what you'd expect.</p>
<p>2- there is a slight bit of memory editing shenanigans going on, as you could guess from the fact that everyone speaks the same language for example</p>

Though she means well, her methods are... questionable. Besides, you cannot reach such a high level if you're not somewhat 'special'. In whatever meaning of the word.</p>
<p>As for the summoning, I feel like I can talk a bit more about it now. It depends on a few things. For Alith, the magic and system tried really hard to fit the description, however it could, summoning a dead young woman.

And despite that, the world can be how it is, there are other powers at play in that, the system for example is one of them.

<p>Let's see what opinions I have to argue about this time...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>she hasn't shown a hint of regret</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah why would she? She did what she wanted to do. People dramatize the soul slap like it was some kind of ungodly torture but this is coming from a person who has killed more than she can count, she's far past being devastated at inflicting some harm. She's sorry that it hurt more than intended but that's it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also don't understand what difference it will make to show what it feels like to any other saint it's not like they have an opinion on when to summon heroes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they do? Not every country and religion treat their saints like the Church does. And Sofia at the moment is also free to chose whether to summon or not, technically... The guildmaster isn't going around doing that to the Saints that are imprisoned, it's because they're free that she feels she needs to 'teach' them...</p>

By today's standard, for sure.</p>
<p>Is it punishing someone that was enslaved and forced to summon heroes? Not really. By the guildmaster's information :</p>
<p>1- Sofia didn't summon anyone during her stay at the church 2- She summoned two Heroes in the meantime 3- Sofia is not currently enslaved.</p>
<p>So she's a 'free' saint, currently summoning heroes left and right, two in a month. Whether she needed to do so to survive isn't even an argument, she summoned them. Since she is willingly summoning Heroes, she must know what it really is. Hence the 'lesson'.</p>
<p>And finally, she probably knows best if it works or not, she's been around for a really long time if she has seen many saints come by.</p>

These details are things I think about. Just that I cut the thinking part from the script, exactly for the sake of flow, not of logic but of pacing.</p>
<p>For example, on the weapon choice. Alith's going for 'war sickles', or kamas, essentially, because she used to defend herself from forest animals with her sickle as an herbalist. Meanwhile Sofia is going for a flanged mace and buckler on the guildmaster's recommendation, as these are quite convenient to carry and to use, especially for someone who doesn't have much experience with wielding weapons. And she skimps on the quality of her own set because she only bought it as a backup/last resort in the first place, since she will always try to be the back-line in fights.</p>
<p>All thing I've taken into account while the characters chose their equipment but I've not included exactly to try making the chapter nicer to read.</p>
<p>Well, it's all a big balancing act in the end, I'm still trying to figure out what works best (￣▽￣)</p>","2 months  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1079704?comment=7691578#comment-7691578"

<p>But to have your kids be born at such high levels and still have a body that pretty much looks 'human', means that it's extremely hard on both the mother and the baby's bodies. And for reasons I can't explain right now, healing magic doesn't help in that case. They have ways around it but they are costly. So for vampires to have kids is either an act of foolishness or a huge financial drain. Each newborn vampire is a precious resource to them, and they highly value every vampire's life.</p>

<p>You indeed get active and passive class skills when you get them, no choice. But you can chose which one to to forget when you take a new one if your slots are full, or to not take the new one, think like pokemon skills.</p>
<p>The princess only had 5 passives, but [Blessing of the Deep] kinda invited itself there.</p>
<p>Of course, she had five passives at level one and no actives, this is just a specificity of the [Princess] class. Every class has some quirks about what skills it learns when.</p>
<p>She only had 5 classless though, which is one less than Sofia who has 6 because she has that compensation slot for her broken class. And classless can be obtained simply by doing/ knowing things. Which is why you can learn some of them by being taught or through a skill scroll. And maybe through some other ways, even ;)</p>

<p>Alright, so, I can't give a definite canon health number, but I can slightly correct a few things here, though I must say, you did a great job with the info available (▼∀▼)</p>
<p>So, the actual hp multiplier for most fighter classes is x2.5, so they have 50 at level one, and get 50 more per level (Only Sofia's mana stat doesn't work like that because it's so bugged, where she had 5000 at level one and gets 500 per level)</p>
<p>So the base health at level 100 would be 5000. Now, Pareth is a very special case, because he has two modifiers. In Holy Skeleton's description it says : ""<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Physical and magical capabilities are influenced by the current bones. ""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Which is rather vague, but the actual meaning is the stats are altered to better represent that of the type of original creature whose skeleton it's occupying (with a range from -50% to +50% depending on the skeleton) in this case the Elven skeleton is pretty close to an human so it would only be a few additional percents. (This part of the skill also represents that he can't properly use the sword without hands etc but that's details)</span></p>
<p>Next is the blessing, which is actually a linear scaling of 100 flat Health and Strength points per kg and not a % buff. But you got the weight correct, so in total, Pareth's health at the time was actually a tiny bit over 9000 ;)</p>
<p>Which is a big amount, but also he had no armor whatsoever so the Siren still absolutely destroyed him. Though he did tank a few hits. You can see how he got annihilated at the end,supposedly by some sort of water spell, when Sofia only took about 300 dmg from the water ball spell. So yeah, armor is a very big deal too.</p>
<p>Now this makes me realize I screwed up with the scaling of [Heal undead] (which I already changed a few times...) so I'll have to go back to look into it...</p>
<p>Anyway, nice job <span style=""font-size: 0.9em""><span style=""font-weight: 400"">(｀• ω •´)b</span></span></p>

<p>I don't even know what to say, no matter what I do people will complain. Besides I find it very weird to say that Sofia doesn't have any agency or that it can't be normal that she has to kill a lvl299 hero when she's the one who's been derailing the trial all this while.</p>
<p>And what's going on is the real goal of the trial just started. It was literally in the title of the trial she chose herself : </p>

It's a hard thing to balance honestly.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff that doesn't make sense upfront will do later, there's a lot of stuff going on with this trial that run deeper than just 'sofia is going to be level 100', plot points that won't be revealed until hundreds of chapters later if things go how I plan. Guess I just like my foreshadowing a bit too much. I'm doing my best alright.To be clear, most of what's happening all the time will be important later, I hope that this whole 'random' bit of the past will help make stuff that comes later make more sense, since you will know how some things came about.</p>
<p>And for everyone who wants Sofia to be more in control, she will, eventually, but right now of course she's being thrown around, she's a teenie tiny level 99 on the chessboard of angels and gods and stuff. How could she not? I'd say she will really start to hit her stride around chapter 100-120. Weak to strong, all this jazz <img src=""https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Eating001-min-AADA50Q8Xgw=.png""></p>
<p>And yeah it's a whole thing to try to make the story good in a chapter to chapter sense while keeping an overall well paced and coherent story. Like, it might feel like the trial has been going on forever but that also was only 15 chapters, that's barely longer than the first arc in the church. And to be honest, kind of a failure on my part but I thought readers would be more interested in learning about the history of the kingdom and such, but I guess not. I never even though that Sofia being in Aurelia's body would be a problem to anyone, to me it was pretty much as if she wore a disguise, though I suppose that turned off some people, as did the demon transformation.</p>
<p>Well, please bear with it, it's almost over, trial ends in two chapters <img src=""https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Love003-min-AACAODU9Xgw=.png""></p>","1 month  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1099452?comment=7853470#comment-7853470"

<p>It's alright, if anything I'm only mad at myself for not writing this whole thing better. I've just been a bit too ambitious with the setting I guess, it ended up making the whole thing be a bit of a mess. Hopefully when more things are uncovered in later arcs you can all come back to this and think 'oh so this is what was going on'.

And she also went the extra mile to kill the hero and such which wasn't required and made it all even harder. But Sofia is a bit of a special case, for some reasons you could guess and some you couldn't yet, so it's even even more fucked than usual, though it's a bit spoiler territory.</p>
<p>Either way, it is an unusual first trial, I think the stats was about two thirds of people make it out of the first one, when clearly this is harder than that. Not a plot hole though.

<p>Now, and because I like make things interesting there's something I'm surprised no one pointed out yet. And it's how she needed to be in the city for the trial's second part to start, but nothing was in place to keep her there.</p>

<p>Don't go getting all angry because you don't like how the story goes, when has the system ever explained how things worked clearly? That's not something it's been doing ever. The only time Sofia gets a full on explanation is when she directly breaks something and gets an error message.</p>

Alright, so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parts don't seem to be logically related</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah that's because they aren't. It's just that they both fit well with what the system wants to test Sofia on, and happen to be chronologically linked. Reminder, this is a piece of real history, not a system crafted situation. And the trial couldn't be just the second part, that would be too short, so it's two parts, related by the fact they happen one after the other. The fact that there's a second part doesn't mean it should be linked to the first or that the first had no reason to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narratively, the quest wasn't presented as a multi-part quest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sofia didn't know so you didn't know, simple as that. And why did the system 'hide it'? It's just not part of the information it gives. Any time you assume you know how the system works is a time where you risk being wrong. For all you know, Sofia could kill herself right now and still get her level 100 for completing the first part. Or maybe she'd just die. Is it explained? Nope. That's how the system is, and considering the system fucking up is how the whole story started, I find it surprising that anyone is still surprised when the system doesn't work like a squeaky-clean well oiled machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, we aren't talking about whether Sofia understands, what's going on. The issue is that the reader doesn't understand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is the narrator 99% of the time. She doesn't get something? Either you piece it together yourself or you wait for her to understand. Simple as that. And all that's going on is that 'surprise', there's another quest after the first. Now was it presented clumsily? Perhaps, or there probably wouldn't be that much discussion about it. But it really isn't that big of a deal even if you don't understand how or why that came about in my opinion. It's there now, and Sofia has to deal with it, that's all it is. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>","1 month  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1099452?comment=7856019#comment-7856019"

Thank you for the clear feedback.</p>
<p>However! I don't think that's too much of a big deal. In my opinion not everything has to have huge tension for the reader. Of course from the reader's perspective the trial is as good as won already but that's not how it is to Sofia. And If you're not interested in seeing how she overcomes the trial then this would mean the real problem isn't the narrative tension at all, but rather me not being able to make it interesting.</p>
<p>Also it's really just fifteen chapters, which isn't that long for it to become a major problem, it's just that the format of webserials make it weird. For comparison the readers on patreon that could read it all at once had no complaints whatsoever. Though of course they might not be an incredible metric to judge the quality of the story, it's still something. Overall, though I think you have a point, I also think it's not a huge deal.</p>

<p>Long story short, I still disagree with your rebuttal there, I can see a million different ways the whole thing could have played out so I can't ever agree that she made no choices. Of course you don't have the same understanding of everything that's happened and the causality of everything so it might not be so obvious from your side though. Guess that's what I ought to work on a bit more.</p>
<p>And just to answer the question about Orvod, yeah there were ways, if he'd made different choices about how he fought. But obviously it would have been a close fight either way if no one made any mistake.

<p>And for the second part, let me shed a tiny shred of light. Of course I cannot go into the details of why it was designed like that, huge spoilers, but I can speak for the frequency thing. Actually the trials do no really get more frequent. What you couldn't take into account is how much harder it is to for example go from level 400 to 401 than it is to go from 200 to 201. As the difficulty in gaining levels gets higher and higher, the trials staying at every fifty level actually spaces them out a lot more for higher levels.</p>

I see why you would think that but I <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">strongly</span> disagree about it being weird.</p>
<p>If we go back to look at Sofia's past, right. She spent most of her youth in an orphanage. That's a world that has no phones, no tv, no internet. And now she's in the wide (and magical) outside world, extensively using the system that no one taught her anything about, by herself, and having to deal with bugs and a borked class. Not only that, she's now in the rather unexplored realm of being at a high-ish level, which despite how it looks is only a very tiny fraction of the population. And as if that wasn't enough, she's now in a different country literally on the other side of the human continent.</p>
<p>Honestly if she knew more about things that's what would be weird. In my opinion.</p>
<p>And that if feels less alien to Alith is entirely because you don't have her point of view. She's just quick (very) to adapt and not too good at externalizing her thoughts most of the time.</p>","20 days  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1129509?comment=8113181#comment-8113181"

<p>- You know, I don’t think there are good or bad situations. If I had to sum up my life today with you, I’d say that this is firstly meetings, people who gave me their hands may be at a moment when I couldn’t, when I was alone at home. And it is a bit curious to realize that coincidences and meetings forge a destiny because when you have the taste of the thing, when you have the taste of the well done thing, the beautiful gesture, sometimes you don’t find the speaker, I’d say, the mirror which helps you to progress. Well, it’s not my case today because I could, and I thank life, I sing life, I dance life, I’m nothing but love. And finally, when a lot of people ask me “How do you do to have this humanity?” I simply answer, it is this taste of love, this taste of water which pushed me today to undertake a mechanic construction but tomorrow, who knows, I would may be serve the community, and give the gift. The gift of myself.</p>

<p>I do know about the tabletop rpg scene, if I'm being honest I write books as if I was GM, I only create settings and I let the characters live in it, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Now for your inquiry, uh... I'd say keep the base ideas but put your own spin on it. Not that I wouldn't love to have something like that based on my book and world, but if you ever want to promote it or make money with it, that'll save us both a headache. As for how much inspiration you should take... I dunno <img src=""https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Giggle001-min-AADAA6Q8Xgw=.png""></p>
<p>The creative process is what it is, everyone takes inspiration from many things, me included. And unless I fucking hit my head on the stairs, I shouldn't come to sue you for using stuff like my original monster designs, which there aren't many of anyway. Well, whatever you decide to do, I can't really stop you unless you start shouting everywhere that these are you original designs and that you're selling them, so just don't do that and use your better judgement depending on what your goal is with this project. Good luck and have fun <img src=""https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/smilies/PenguinGirlEmoticon_Gentleman001-min-AABA64k8Xgw=.png""></p>","3 days  ago","https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/1145418?comment=8241086#comment-8241086"
